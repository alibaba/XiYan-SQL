## Introduction
**XiYan-SQL** is an innovative natural language to SQL conversion framework designed to address the performance challenges of large language models in SQL generation tasks. 
This framework introduces a multi-generator ensemble strategy, enhancing SQL generation capabilities by integrating various SQL LLMs. 
XiYan-SQL employs multi-task and multi-format training strategies, producing high-quality and diverse SQL models. It also incorporates algorithms such as M-Schema, Schema Filter, and SQL candidate selection to achieve optimal SQL generation performance.

XiYan-SQL has achieved top rankings in several internationally recognized benchmarks, including BIRD-2023, BIRD-Critic, and Spider, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness across different scenarios. 

For developers, XiYan-SQL offers multiple models and corresponding source code, facilitating further research and application. 
Contributions to the XiYan-SQL project are welcome!
